# HSK Anki Deck Generator

Generate Anki flashcard decks for HSK Chinese vocabulary (levels 1-7) with AI-generated example sentences and native audio.

## Card Preview

</p>

The cards show the target Hanzi and example sentence on the front, then reveal the reading and supporting information on the back.

## Overview

This project creates Anki decks for studying Chinese using the new HSK 3.0 vocabulary lists of the 2021 national standard (GF0025-2021; see `complete-hsk-vocabulary/standard.json`). Supports any combination of HSK levels 1-7. Each card includes:
- Target vocabulary word with pinyin
- AI-generated example sentence using constrained vocabulary
- Tone-colored pinyin on the back of the card
- Native Chinese word audio via Microsoft Edge Neural TTS by default
- Native Chinese sentence audio via ElevenLabs when configured, with Microsoft Edge Neural fallback when no key is present
- English translations
- Progressive difficulty (sentences only use previously learned words)

The raw HSK source lists are vendored directly in this repository under `complete-hsk-vocabulary/`, so the project does not depend on GitHub resolving an external submodule correctly.

## The Approach

### Constrained Sentence Generation

The key insight is that example sentences should only use vocabulary the learner already knows. This prevents the frustrating experience of looking up every word in the example sentence.

**How it works:**
1. Cards are sorted by frequency (most common words first)
2. Each sentence only uses:
   - Words learned before this card
   - A seed vocabulary of ~80 common function words (的, 了, 是, etc.)
   - The target word itself
3. DeepSeek AI generates contextually appropriate sentences within these constraints. Deepseek is preferred because presumably it has a higher percentage of chinese vocabulary in its training data, and caching makes generating new cards with previously learned vocabulary very cheap.

**Example progression:**
- Card 1 learns "你" (you) → sentence uses only seed words + 你
- Card 50 learns "喜欢" (like) → sentence can use 你 + 49 other learned words + 喜欢
- Card 500 learns "复杂" (complex) → sentence can use all 499 previous words + 复杂

### Two-Stage Cleaning

**Stage 1: Vocabulary Cleaning** (`clean_vocabulary.py`)
- Handles multi-pronunciation words (e.g., 了 can be "le" or "liǎo")
- Creates separate cards for each distinct pronunciation
- Filters out rare/literary/surname usages
- Uses DeepSeek to make intelligent decisions about which readings to include, since common words can have distinct readings that are equally common.

**Stage 2: Deck Generation** (`generate_deck.py`)
- Generates contextually appropriate sentences with vocabulary constraints
- Generates Microsoft Edge Neural audio for each target word by default
- Generates sentence audio with ElevenLabs when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set
- Falls back to Microsoft Edge Neural sentence audio when ElevenLabs is not configured
- Applies tone coloring to the back-side word pinyin, including numbered readings such as `nu:3` and `lü4`
- Builds Anki package with subdecks for each HSK level

## Requirements

```bash
# Python packages
uv pip install openai elevenlabs edge-tts genanki python-dotenv

# API Keys (in .env file)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Optional
```

## Usage

### 1. Clean Vocabulary (First Time Only)

```bash
uv run clean_vocabulary.py
# Select HSK levels when prompted
# Examples: "1", "1,2", "1,2,3", or "1,2,3,4,5,6,7"
```

This processes the raw HSK vocabulary and creates cleaned JSON files in `data/cleaned/`.

### 2. Generate Deck

```bash
uv run generate_deck.py
# Select HSK levels when prompted
# Examples:
#   "1"       → HSK_1_cleaned.apkg
#   "1,2,3"   → HSK_1-3_cleaned.apkg
#   "4,5"     → HSK_4-5_cleaned.apkg
#   "1,2,3,4,5,6,7" → HSK_1-7_cleaned.apkg
```

This generates:
- AI sentences for each card
- Word audio files
- Sentence audio files
- Complete Anki deck (.apkg file)

Output: `decks/HSK_{levels}_cleaned.apkg`

## Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Batch sentence generation and concurrent audio generation
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for API limits
- **Smart Vocabulary**: Only uses words the learner should already know
- **Word Audio by Default**: Microsoft Edge Neural reads each target word
- **Sentence Audio Fallback**: Sentence audio uses ElevenLabs when available, otherwise Microsoft Edge Neural
- **Tone Coloring**: The back-side pinyin is colorized by tone and normalizes numbered pinyin such as `lu:4` to marked pinyin
- **Multiple Pronunciations**: Separate cards for words like 了 (le/liǎo), 行 (xíng/háng)

## Performance

Parallel processing with 10 sentence workers and 5 audio workers:

- **HSK 1** (~530 cards): ~10-15 minutes
- **HSK 1-3** (~2,300 cards): ~30-45 minutes
- **HSK 1-7** (~11,500 cards): ~2-3 hours

## Card Format

**Front:**
- Target word in large text
- Example sentence (target word highlighted in green)
- Word audio plays automatically

**Back:**
- Word pinyin with tone coloring
- Sentence pinyin
- English translation (hidden by default, click to reveal)
- Word meaning (hidden by default, click to reveal)
- Sentence audio plays on the back

## Troubleshooting

### Most Audio Files Failed (0 bytes)
- This usually happens when hitting API or network limits
- The script uses 5 workers to avoid this in ElevenLabs, and retries transient failures automatically.
- Automatic retry logic handles transient failures

### API Quota Exceeded
- **DeepSeek**: Check usage at https://platform.deepseek.com/usage
- **ElevenLabs**: Check quota at https://elevenlabs.io/app

### Missing Microsoft Neural TTS
- Install `edge-tts` in the project environment:
  `uv pip install edge-tts`
- Without `edge-tts`, the generator cannot use Microsoft Edge Neural voices for word audio or fallback sentence audio.

### Import Into Anki
1. Open Anki
2. File → Import
3. Select `decks/HSK_X-Y_cleaned.apkg`
4. Done!
